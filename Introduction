Hey everyone,

I'm new to Github and look forward to meeting everyone I can. 
I am interested in front-end web development and I'm looking to pursue that as a career.

I would love to contribute to people's projects but just looking through them has my head spinning.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Feel free to send me a message.
